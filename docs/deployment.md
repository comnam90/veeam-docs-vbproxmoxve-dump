# Deployment


Starting from version 12.2, the Veeam Backup & Replication solution allows you to add Proxmox VE servers to the backup infrastructure, and to manage data protection and recovery operations for Proxmox VE workloads from a single console.

To access the Veeam Plug-in for Proxmox VE functionality, you can either deploy a new backup server as described in the [Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/deployment.html?ver=13) or use a backup server that already exists in your backup infrastructure if it meets the [Veeam Plug-in for Proxmox VE system requirements](system_requirements.md).
