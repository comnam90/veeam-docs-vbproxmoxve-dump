# Step 4. Configure Backup Destination Settings


At the Storage step of the wizard, do the following:

1. In the Backup repository drop-down list, select a backup repository where you want to store backups.

For a backup repository to be displayed in the list of available repositories, it must be [added to the backup infrastructure](configure_repository.md).

| Note |
| Veeam Backup & Replication Community Edition does not support [deduplicating storage appliances](configure_repository.md) for storing Proxmox VE VM backups. |

1. In the Retention policy section, choose how long Veeam Backup & Replication will keep restore points in a backup chain. If a restore point is older than the specified limit, Veeam Backup & Replication will remove it from the chain. For more information on how Veeam Backup & Replication tracks and removes redundant restore points, see [Retention Policies](retention_policy.md).

Keep in mind that since every backup chain must contain at least 3 restore points, Veeam Backup & Replication may ignore the configured retention policy settings and retain restore points for longer periods of time. For more information, see [Backup Retention](backup_retention.md).

| Note |
| If the UUID of a VM changes (for example, if the VM migrates to another cluster), Veeam Backup & Replication will be unable to continue the backup chain for this VM. After you re-add the VM to the backup job, Veeam Backup & Replication will start a new backup chain for it. However, you will still be able to perform restore operations using backups from the old backup chain. |

To help you implement a comprehensive backup strategy, Veeam Backup & Replication allows you to [enable long-term retention policy for backups](backup_job_create_gfs.md) and to [configure advanced job settings](backup_job_create_advanced.md) (such as notification settings, health check, active and synthetic full backups).
